# Formula 1 Fan Ratings Analysis 


## üèéÔ∏è Project Overview 

This project explores **whether Formula 1 race ratings are influenced more by the winning driver, the winning constructor, the track location, or the seasonal placement**.<br>  
By analyzing **historical race data (2008-2018)**, we aim to understand what makes a race more exciting for fans.  

### **Factors Being Analyzed**  
- **Winning Driver** ‚Äì Do highly rated races feature **popular drivers** like Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen? Do **surprise winners** increase fan engagement?  
- **Winning Constructor (Team)** ‚Äì Do **dominant teams** (e.g., Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari) affect ratings? Are fans more excited when an **underdog team** wins?  
- **Track Location** ‚Äì Are certain circuits (like Monaco, Silverstone, or Spa) consistently rated higher? Do **historic or high-speed tracks** make races more thrilling?  
- **Seasonal Placement** ‚Äì Does the **timing of the race** within the season (early, mid, or late) impact fan engagement? Do final championship-deciding races get higher ratings?  

To analyze this, we will use **historical race data from 2008 to 2018**, examining how **fan ratings correlate with different race characteristics**.<br>  
By identifying these patterns, we aim to provide insights into what makes a Formula 1 race **truly exciting for fans**.

## üèéÔ∏è Research Questions and Objectives 
- Explore how race outcomes are affected by the winning driver, the winning constructor, track location, and seasonal placement, and how these factors influence fan ratings.<br>
- Pinpoint which race characteristics most strongly impact fan engagement, determining whether fans care more about driver performance, team dominance, track uniqueness, or race timing.)<br>
- Leverage race data to identify trends in fan ratings, helping uncover the elements that make a race more exciting and enjoyable for audiences.<br>
- Utilize techniques from the DSA 210 course, including data merging, visualization, and modeling, to apply real-world data science principles in sports analytics.<br>

## üèéÔ∏è Motivation 
I have always been fascinated by **Formula 1**, not just as a sport but also as a cultural phenomenon.<br>  
Recently, I noticed a recurring debate online:  

> *"Do people, especially girls, watch F1 because of the drivers, or because of the sport itself?"*  

Some argue that **drivers have celebrity status**, influencing fan engagement more than the actual racing.<br>  
Others claim that **team performance and race excitement matter more** than individual personalities.<br>  

This debate made me curious:  
- **Do fan ratings depend more on the winning driver or the winning team?**  
- **Are certain tracks or seasons naturally more exciting, or does a popular driver winning boost engagement?**  
- **Can data actually prove whether F1 drivers are more than just athletes‚Äîbut also celebrities?**  
Through this project, I want to **go beyond opinions and use data to find answers**.<br>  
By analyzing **race results, fan ratings, and track information**, I hope to uncover whether **Formula 1 fandom is driven by the sport itself or the personalities of its stars**.<br>  

Additionally, this project gives me the chance to apply **real-world data science skills** from my **DSA 210 course**, allowing me to explore how data-driven insights can shape our understanding of sports and entertainment.

## üèéÔ∏è Datasets & Data Collection 
The following table contains the datasets I will be exploiting along wiht thier description and usage.  
| Dataset                   | Description                          | Usage                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `results.xlsx`             | Finishing positions of drivers      | Identify the winning driver   |
| `constructor_standings.xlsx` | Constructor rankings each season  | Find the winning constructor  |
| `races.xlsx`              | Contains track locations & race dates | Extract track & month info    |
| `fan_ratings.xlsx`        | Fan ratings for each race           | The dependent variable        |

### The variables being analyzed are:
- The fan ratings, Winning Drivers; compiled from previously released records on racefans.net  
- Track name  
- Seasonal Placement of Race    
- Winning constructor;  
  - previously mentioned data (except ratings, and winning drivers) all taken from a publicly avaiable dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melissamonfared/formula-1?select=circuits.csv <br>
  
The Excel file (.xlsx) containing fan ratings and winning drivers will serve as the primary dataset. It will be enriched by merging additional .xlsx files, incorporating relevant independent variables from the remaining datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## üèéÔ∏è Hypothesis  

- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** The **race winner, winning constructor, track location, and seasonal placement** have **no significant impact** on fan ratings.  
    - assumes that race ratings are random and not affected by the variables being analyzed.  
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** At least one of these factors **significantly influences** fan ratings, meaning that race excitement is affected by **who wins, where the race is held, or when it takes place**.  
    - suggests that one or more of these factors do impact how fans rate a race.  

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  

## üèéÔ∏è Dataset Analysis Plan 
### Data Collection  

- Import race data from multiple CSV files into a **Pandas DataFrame** for structured analysis.  
- Preprocess the dataset by **handling missing values, standardizing formats**, and merging relevant tables (e.g., results, driver standings, constructor rankings).  
 

### Visualization  

To explore relationships between variables, I will use:  

- **Scatter Plots** ‚Üí Example: Winning **driver vs. fan ratings** to see if certain drivers generate higher engagement.  
- **Bar Charts** ‚Üí Compare **race ratings** based on **winning constructor, track location, and seasonal placement**.  
- **Line Graphs** ‚Üí Analyze **fan rating trends** across different seasons, identifying patterns over time.  


### Hypothesis Testing  

- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis):** The **race winner, constructor, track location, and seasonal placement** have **no significant impact** on fan ratings.  
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis):** One or more of these factors **significantly influence** how fans rate a race.  

To test this, I will use suitable methods from the course, tentative to selection changes.  
 

### Trend Analysis  

- Identify patterns in **fan engagement over time**, determining whether certain seasons or rule changes influence ratings.  
- Investigate whether **track type (street circuit vs. traditional), race length, or pit stop strategies** impact fan excitement.  
- Analyze whether **races later in the season** (e.g., title deciders) receive higher ratings than early-season races.

## üèéÔ∏è Tools and Technologies  

To analyze and visualize the data effectively, I will utilize the following tools:  

- **Python** ‚Üí The core programming language for handling datasets, performing statistical analysis, and running models, either through Google Colab or Visual Studio Code.  
- **Pandas** ‚Üí Essential for **data preprocessing, filtering, and transformation** to prepare insights.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Üí Used for generating **graphs, heatmaps, and trend visualizations** to better understand the relationship between variables.

## üèéÔ∏è Expected Outcomes  
By the end of this project, the aim is to answer:<br>

Do fans care more about the driver or the team winning?<br>
Are certain tracks or seasonal placements more exciting?<br>
Can we predict fan ratings based on race data?<br>
